# PlayBern.ch 

WIP.

## Requirements

This site is powered by [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io) 

- Git, [Node.js Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), Yarn installed for local development.
- A [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io) account for live editing.

## Local Development

Install the project's dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Run the project locally:

```
yarn dev
```

### Local URLs

- http://localhost:3000 : browse the website
- http://localhost:3000/admin : connect to Tina Cloud and go in edit mode
- http://localhost:3000/exit-admin : log out of Tina Cloud
- http://localhost:4001/altair/ : GraphQL playground to test queries and browse the API documentation

### Building the Starter Locally (Using the hosted content API)

Replace the `.env.example`, with `.env`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=<get this from the project you create at app.tina.io>
TINA_TOKEN=<get this from the project you create at app.tina.io>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH=<Specify the branch with Tina configured>
```

## Development tips

### Visual Studio Code GraphQL extension

[Install the GraphQL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) to benefit from type auto-completion.

### Typescript

A good way to ensure your components match the shape of your data is to leverage the auto-generated TypeScript types.
These are rebuilt when your `tina` config changes.
